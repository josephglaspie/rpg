## Kubernetes Deployment (Minikube)

Deploy the RPG game to your local minikube cluster and access it through your browser.

### Prerequisites
- [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) installed and running
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) configured to work with minikube
- Docker (for building the image locally)

### Quick Start

1. **Start minikube with ingress addon:**
   ```bash
   minikube start
   minikube addons enable ingress
   ```

2. **Build and load the Docker image into minikube:**
   ```bash
   # Build the Docker image
   docker build -t josephglaspie/rpg-game:latest .
   
   # Push the image to Dockerhub
    docker push josephglaspie/rpg-game:latest
   ```

3. **Deploy to Kubernetes:**
   ```bash
   # Apply all Kubernetes manifests
   kubectl apply -f k8s/
   ```

4. **Set up local DNS (add to /etc/hosts):**
   ```bash
   # Get minikube IP
   minikube ip
   
   # Add this line to your /etc/hosts file (replace <MINIKUBE_IP> with actual IP):
   # <MINIKUBE_IP> rpg-game.local
   echo "$(minikube ip) rpg-game.local" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
   ```

5. **Access the game:**
   - Open your browser and go to: **http://rpg-game.local**
   - The game should load and be ready to play!

### Alternative Access Methods

**Option 1: Port Forwarding (no DNS setup needed):**
```bash
kubectl port-forward -n rpg-game service/rpg-game-service 8081:80
# Then visit: http://localhost:8081
```

**Option 2: Minikube Service (opens automatically):**
```bash
minikube service rpg-game-service -n rpg-game
```

### Deployment Management

**Check deployment status:**
```bash
kubectl get pods -n rpg-game
kubectl get services -n rpg-game
kubectl get ingress -n rpg-game
```

**View logs:**
```bash
kubectl logs -n rpg-game -l app=rpg-game -f
```

**Scale the deployment:**
```bash
kubectl scale deployment rpg-game -n rpg-game --replicas=3
```

**Clean up:**
```bash
# Remove all resources
kubectl delete -f k8s/

# Remove from /etc/hosts
sudo sed -i '/rpg-game.local/d' /etc/hosts
```

## ArgoCD Deployment

Deploy and manage the RPG game using ArgoCD for GitOps-based continuous deployment.

### Prerequisites
- ArgoCD installed in your cluster
- This repository accessible to ArgoCD (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
- kubectl configured for your cluster

### Setup ArgoCD Application

1. **Access ArgoCD UI:**
   ```bash
   # Get admin password
   kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d; echo
   
   # Port forward ArgoCD server
   kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443
   
   # Open https://localhost:8080 and login with admin/<password>
   ```

2. **Create Application via UI:**
   - Click "NEW APP"
   - Fill in the following details:
     - **Application Name:** `rpg-game`
     - **Project:** `default`
     - **Sync Policy:** `Automatic` (optional)
     - **Repository URL:** `https://github.com/your-username/rpg` (replace with your repo)
     - **Revision:** `HEAD` or specific branch
     - **Path:** `k8s`
     - **Destination Cluster:** `https://kubernetes.default.svc`
     - **Namespace:** `rpg-game`
   - Click "CREATE"

3. **Create Application via CLI:**
   ```bash
   # Install ArgoCD CLI if not already installed
   # See: https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cli_installation/
   
   # Login to ArgoCD
   argocd login localhost:8080
   
   # Create the application
   argocd app create rpg-game \
     --repo https://github.com/your-username/rpg \
     --path k8s \
     --dest-server https://kubernetes.default.svc \
     --dest-namespace rpg-game \
     --sync-policy automated \
     --auto-prune \
     --self-heal
   ```

4. **Create Application via YAML manifest:**
   ```bash
   # Apply the ArgoCD Application manifest
   kubectl apply -f argocd/application.yaml
   ```

### Managing the Application

**Sync the application:**
```bash
argocd app sync rpg-game
```

**Check application status:**
```bash
argocd app get rpg-game
```

**View application logs:**
```bash
argocd app logs rpg-game
```

**Delete the application:**
```bash
argocd app delete rpg-game
```

### Automatic Deployments

With ArgoCD configured:
1. Any changes to `k8s/` manifests in your repository will trigger automatic deployment
2. ArgoCD will continuously monitor and sync your application state
3. View deployment history and rollback capabilities through the ArgoCD UI
4. Set up webhooks for faster sync times (optional)

### Troubleshooting ArgoCD

**Application stuck in sync:**
```bash
# Check application events
argocd app get rpg-game
kubectl get events -n rpg-game

# Force refresh
argocd app get rpg-game --refresh
```

**Reset admin password:**
```bash
# Delete the secret to reset password
kubectl -n argocd delete secret argocd-initial-admin-secret
kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d; echo
```

### Troubleshooting

- **Ingress not working?** Wait a few minutes for the ingress controller to start, or try `minikube addons disable ingress && minikube addons enable ingress`
- **Image not found?** Make sure you ran `minikube image load josephglaspie/rpg-game:latest`
- **Can't access the game?** Check that minikube is running with `minikube status`
