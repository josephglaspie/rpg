## Kubernetes Deployment (Minikube)

Deploy the RPG game to your local minikube cluster and access it through your browser.

### Prerequisites
- [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) installed and running
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) configured to work with minikube
- Docker (for building the image locally)

### Quick Start

1. **Start minikube with ingress addon:**
   ```bash
   minikube start
   minikube addons enable ingress
   ```

2. **Build and load the Docker image into minikube:**
   ```bash
   # Build the Docker image
   docker build -t josephglaspie/rpg-game:latest .
   
   # Push the image to Dockerhub
    docker push josephglaspie/rpg-game:latest
   ```

3. **Deploy to Kubernetes:**
   ```bash
   # Apply all Kubernetes manifests
   kubectl apply -f k8s/
   ```

4. **Set up local DNS (add to /etc/hosts):**
   ```bash
   # Get minikube IP
   minikube ip
   
   # Add this line to your /etc/hosts file (replace <MINIKUBE_IP> with actual IP):
   # <MINIKUBE_IP> rpg-game.local
   echo "$(minikube ip) rpg-game.local" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
   ```

5. **Access the game:**
   - Open your browser and go to: **http://rpg-game.local**
   - The game should load and be ready to play!

### Alternative Access Methods

**Option 1: Port Forwarding (no DNS setup needed):**
```bash
kubectl port-forward -n rpg-game service/rpg-game-service 8081:80
# Then visit: http://localhost:8081
```

**Option 2: Minikube Service (opens automatically):**
```bash
minikube service rpg-game-service -n rpg-game
```

### Deployment Management

**Check deployment status:**
```bash
kubectl get pods -n rpg-game
kubectl get services -n rpg-game
kubectl get ingress -n rpg-game
```

**View logs:**
```bash
kubectl logs -n rpg-game -l app=rpg-game -f
```

**Scale the deployment:**
```bash
kubectl scale deployment rpg-game -n rpg-game --replicas=3
```

**Clean up:**
```bash
# Remove all resources
kubectl delete -f k8s/

# Remove from /etc/hosts
sudo sed -i '/rpg-game.local/d' /etc/hosts
```

### Troubleshooting

- **Ingress not working?** Wait a few minutes for the ingress controller to start, or try `minikube addons disable ingress && minikube addons enable ingress`
- **Image not found?** Make sure you ran `minikube image load josephglaspie/rpg-game:latest`
- **Can't access the game?** Check that minikube is running with `minikube status`
